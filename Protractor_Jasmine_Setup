(for debugging in Webstorm)(It expects the cli.js to be in /usr/lib/node_modules/protractor/lib/cli.js 
but mine was in /usr/local/lib/node_modules/protractor/built/cli.js.
This means its installed globally but this can be installed locally into your projects)

When degugging and sticking breakpoints on lines of codes, may have to add promises to the protractor methods and then stick a breakpoint inside the promise.
e.g browser.get('https://angularjs.org').then(function (result) {
          browser.getCurrentUrl().then(function (result) {
           console.log(result);
          })
        });
