NOTE ****CHROME WELCOME SCREEN ON EMULATORS *******
When using webdriver-manager to run off emulator welcome screen did not appear on api level 24 with CPU "Google Apis Intel Atoms (x86_64)" 7.0.0
welcome screen did appear on level 25 "Google Apis Intel Atoms (x86_64)" 7.1.1

************ UPDATE ON WELCOME SCREEN *************
 Setup AVD emulator Intel Atom x86 or Google Api Intel Atom x86 (I got it working for both)
 Got around that by downloading the latest version of Chrome here http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/chrome/ (Download the x86 apk)
 You can drag the apk into the emulator and it will install on the emulator
 
 Pixel Launcher Keeps stopping - Update apk here http://www.appsapk.com/go-launcher-ex/ (Just drag and drop after you download it)
